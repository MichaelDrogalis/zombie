# zombie

A Clojure library to facilitate abstract creation of test data. Sometimes you don't care about the concrete differences between data. Test cases can be simplified by amplifying the differences between data, while at the same time ignoring any similiarities. It's sort of like [QuickCheck](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck). This is best shown by the examples below.

## Installation

Add the following to your `:dependencies`

    [zombie "0.0.1"]

## Usage

Here's a grossly simplified example of data creation with Zombie:

    (fact
     (let [mike {:age 21}
           bill (is-like mike (but-it (has-a-different :age)))]
       (not= (:age mike) (:age bill)))
     => true)

Time can be manipulated:

    (fact
     (let [mike {:birthday (time/date-time 1991 1 13)}
           owen (is-like mike (but-it (has-an-earlier :birthday)))]
       (time/before? (:birthday owen) (:birthday mike)))
     => true)

A `specified-by` function allows access to all the vars via a var named 'all'. Data can then be anonymously named.

    (specified-by
     [my-expectations {:grade :A}
      _               {:grade :B}
      _               {:grade :C}]
     (fact (count all) => 3)
     (fact (apply not= all) => true))
